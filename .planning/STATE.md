# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Compress months of repetitive Odoo module development into days by extending GSD's orchestration with Odoo-specialized agents, knowledge, and validation.
**Architecture:** GSD extension (not standalone CLI)
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - GSD Extension + Odoo Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (GSD Extension + Odoo Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-01 -- Roadmap rebuilt for GSD extension architecture

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Architecture]: odoo-gen is a GSD extension, not a standalone CLI tool
- [Architecture]: Depend on GSD (not fork) — benefit from upstream updates
- [Architecture]: Clone-based install into ~/.claude/odoo-gen/
- [Architecture]: UI UX Pro Max Skill pattern for reasoning engine + rule library
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is GSD extension setup + Odoo foundation (not CLI build)
- [Roadmap]: Knowledge Base moved to Phase 2 (before validation, so agents have expertise)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 can run in parallel after Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: Old standalone CLI plans deleted — wrong architecture

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- gh CLI not authenticated -- needed for Phase 8 (GitHub API search). Not blocking until then.
- sentence-transformers pulls PyTorch (~2GB) -- plan CPU-only install strategy for Phase 8.
- GSD must be installed as prerequisite -- document in setup instructions.
